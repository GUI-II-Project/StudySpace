# Study Space
Getting into flow state is hard. And one key barrier? Scattered study tools.

Imagine being so immersed in your studies that the perception of time fades away, distractions magically disappear, and learning feels practically effortless. This is the flow state, a powerful cognitive mode of complete focus and clarity.

But getting into flow state is hard. And one key barrier? Scattered study tools. It often feel like students spend more time setting up to study than actually studying. Constant application flipping and context switching breaks concentration and makes it harder to enter and sustain a flow state.

Study Space solves this problem.
